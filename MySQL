# a brief mysql note

#### INT AUTO_INCREMENT
For this type, the key was set as 0 first time.
And each time the value (which is not set) increment by 1 automatically.
Once it was specified by a accurate value, plus the next time if it was not specified.

### For the NOT NULL and without DEFAULT key word.
if the table items input was not specified, stored as NULL.
